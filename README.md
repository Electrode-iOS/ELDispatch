Provides useful Swift language constructs to oft-used Grand Central Dispatch patterns

Grand Central Dispatch is a powerful framework, but it can easily be difficult for someone to grasp how to use it well. With Swift, we can provide language constructs such as enumerations to allow dispatching closures to various prenamed priorities, such as .Background. We can also make using GCD groups easier through function chaining.
